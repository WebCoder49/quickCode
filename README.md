## Discontinued

This code is old and has several known bugs including:
- The Replit execution environment does not work. The Replit company has paywalled several features and changed their setup, which caused this.
- The three-dot icon next to files deletes the file rather than showing several options, since the latter was not implemented.

**[My `code-input` library](https://github.com/WebCoder49/code-input) is a more modular, feature-complete and stable replacement for the editor component here.**

If you're looking for a simple, usable-without-server-storage, browser-based HTML/CSS/JS editor, a free and open-source software replacement is [Raspberry Pi's Editor](https://editor.raspberrypi.org) ([repository](https://github.com/RaspberryPiFoundation/editor-ui)).
